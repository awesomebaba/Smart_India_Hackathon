**Satellite imagery detection** plays a vital role in monitoring and analyzing Earth's surface, especially for environmental applications like oil spill detection. Satellites equipped with high-resolution sensors capture detailed images of vast ocean areas, allowing for the identification of anomalies such as oil slicks, which have distinct visual and reflective properties compared to water.

In this project, after an anomaly is detected through AIS data, the flagged location is verified with satellite imagery for a **second check.** The satellite imagery helps to confirm the presence of an oil spill by analyzing the water's surface for changes in texture, color, or reflectivity.

This process ensures a more accurate and reliable detection system, combining AIS data and satellite imagery for efficient, real-time monitoring of marine environments. The integration enhances the ability to respond quickly to potential spills, minimizing environmental damage.
