The **Automatic Identification System (AIS)** is a real-time tracking technology used to monitor ships and vessels at sea. Ships are equipped with AIS transponders that automatically send signals to other ships, coastal stations, and satellites. These signals contain key information about the vessel, including:

**Vessel Identification:** Unique identifiers like the IMO number, call sign, and vessel name.

#Position Data: Latitude and longitude coordinates that indicate the ship’s exact location.


#Speed Over Ground (SOG): The speed at which the ship is moving.


#Course Over Ground (COG): The direction in which the ship is heading.


#Heading: The angle of the ship’s orientation relative to the North.

#Type of Vessel: The category or class of the ship (e.g., cargo ship, tanker).

#Dimensions: The length, width, and draught (how deep the ship sits in the water).

#Destination: The intended port or location where the ship is heading.

#Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA): The expected time the vessel will reach its destination.

#Cargo Details: Information about the type and quantity of cargo onboard.

AIS works by continuously transmitting this information over **radio frequencies**, which can be picked up by other vessels, coastal stations, or even satellites. This data helps in preventing collisions by allowing ships to see each other’s movements, especially in crowded or dangerous waters.

In addition to safety, AIS is also used for **monitoring unusual behaviors, such as sudden speed changes, erratic movements, or stops, which can indicate a ship in distress** or involved in incidents like oil spills. This makes AIS an essential tool for both maritime safety and environmental protection.
